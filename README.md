## **Overview**

This repository summarizes our work for the **Enterprise Mobility Case Competition**, where teams were challenged to develop a strategic and product-driven solution to rising fleet acquisition costs caused by new U.S. vehicle tariffs.

The competition focused on designing a **client-facing strategy** and an **innovative product** that would protect revenue, strengthen relationships with corporate accounts, and reinforce Enterprise Mobility’s brand as a transparent, technology-forward mobility leader.

---

## **Business Problem**

Beginning **April 2025**, imported passenger vehicles and light trucks will face a **25% tariff**, raising Enterprise’s acquisition cost of new fleet inventory. These rising costs, paired with annual MSRP increases, raise the **break-even point** on Enterprise’s P&L.

Meanwhile:

- Top corporate accounts are reviewing their contracts  
- Many plan to **reduce travel spending**  
- The business rental team must raise daily rental rates  
- Enterprise must do so **without damaging client trust or loyalty**

### **Central Question**
**How can Enterprise justify necessary rate increases, preserve loyalty with its largest accounts, and deliver added value—even as travel budgets shrink?**

---

## **Strategic Solution: ECAT**
### **Enterprise Corporate Alliance Tool**

To solve this challenge, I designed **ECAT**, an AI-powered corporate transparency and loyalty platform built to:

- Clearly communicate cost drivers  
- Provide personalized savings recommendations  
- Strengthen long-term relationships  
- Increase retention through tiered incentives  
- Support the rental team in renewal meetings  
- Turn uncomfortable price conversations into **data-driven partnership discussions**

---

## **Why ECAT Works**

ECAT extends Enterprise Mobility’s core strengths into a scalable digital tool:

- **Robust technology infrastructure** (data, booking, fleet management)  
- **Global presence** with 9,500+ branches  
- **Strong Fortune 500 partnerships**  
- **Powerful CRM and analytics capabilities**

These assets give Enterprise the foundation to deliver transparent pricing and value-backed loyalty incentives.

---

## **AI Integration**

We used AI specifically as a **development tool**, applying prompt engineering to build and refine the ECAT application. AI supported:

- Generating UI concepts and screen layouts  
- Speeding up front-end component creation  
- Drafting product copy, tier descriptions, and transparency messaging  
- Assisting with prototyping flows for the account review experience  
- Automating repetitive content creation during app development  

AI **did not** generate analytics, predictive models, or usage forecasts.  
All business insights, financial analysis, and strategic reasoning were created manually by the team.

AI’s role was focused on **accelerating product development**, improving clarity, and helping produce a high-quality ECAT prototype quickly.

## **ECAT Program Structure**

### **Tiered Incentives: Silver, Gold, Platinum**
- Priority fleet access  
- Delivery guarantees  
- Usage-based savings  
- Upgrade recommendations  
- Transparent pricing dashboards  

### **Strategic Objectives**
- Maintain profitability amid rising acquisition costs  
- Preserve enterprise-level account loyalty  
- Reinforce transparency as a core differentiator  
- Offer measurable ROI to corporate clients
- Clear pricing explanations and documentation generated during app development with AI assistance  
 

---

## **Financial & Economic Insights**

- The 25% tariff increases Enterprise’s fleet costs by **~$256M annually**  
- Pre-tariff inflation already added **~$45M yearly**  
- Market effects include higher rental rates and lower volume  
- Higher prices shift market equilibrium and reduce demand  

To succeed, Enterprise must justify **value, not just cost**.

---

## **Meeting Strategy for Corporate Reviews**

The renewal meeting framework is built on **transparency, data, and collaboration**:

### **1. Lead with transparency**  
Use ECAT’s cost breakdowns to explain why rates must rise.

### **2. Analyze the account’s usage**  
Show annual behavior, trends, and areas of overspending.

### **3. Introduce ECAT tiers**  
Highlight how benefits offset higher daily rates.

### **4. Emphasize long-term value**  
Focus on reliability, availability, and global consistency.

### **5. Build a next-year plan together**  
Tailor fleet access, upgrade credits, and travel optimization strategies.

**Goal:** Turn a difficult financial discussion into a **co-created strategy meeting**.

---

## **KPIs for ECAT Success**

- **90%** fleet utilization  
- **10%** YoY revenue growth per corporate client  
- **80%** enrollment in year one  
- **12%** improvement in retention  
- **25%** Gold/Platinum penetration by Year 2  
- **100,000+** monthly bookings attributed to ECAT  

---

## **Conclusion**

The ECAT platform provides a scalable, AI-driven solution that:

- Strengthens Enterprise Mobility’s financial resilience  
- Deepens long-term corporate partnerships  
- Reinforces transparency as a competitive advantage  
- Turns rising tariffs into an opportunity for innovation  

With the combination of **product strategy**, **analytics**, and **human-centered thinking**, ECAT positions Enterprise to lead the future of corporate mobility solutions.
