#Enterprise Case Competition – ECAT Strategy & Product Design
AI-Driven Transparency & Corporate Loyalty Platform
Overview

This repository summarizes my work for the Enterprise Mobility Case Competition, where teams were challenged to develop a strategic and product-driven solution to rising fleet acquisition costs caused by new U.S. vehicle tariffs.

The competition focused on designing a client-facing strategy and an innovative product that would protect revenue, strengthen relationships with corporate accounts, and reinforce Enterprise Mobility’s brand as a transparent, technology-forward mobility leader.

Business Problem

Beginning April 2025, imported passenger vehicles and light trucks will face a 25% tariff, raising Enterprise’s acquisition cost of new fleet inventory. These costs compound with yearly vehicle design updates and rising MSRP, increasing the break-even point on Enterprise’s P&L.

At the same time:

Several top corporate accounts are reviewing their contracts

Many are planning to reduce business travel spending

The business rental team must conduct renewal meetings that require raising daily rental rates

Enterprise must do so without losing client trust or loyalty

Question:
How can Enterprise justify necessary rate increases, preserve loyalty with its largest accounts, and deliver added value—even as travel budgets shrink?

Strategic Solution: ECAT – Enterprise Corporate Alliance Tool

To address this challenge, I designed ECAT, an AI-powered corporate transparency and loyalty platform built to:

Communicate cost drivers clearly and honestly

Provide personalized savings recommendations

Strengthen long-term client relationships

Increase retention by offering tiered incentives

Help the business rental team conduct more productive and transparent account review meetings

ECAT reframes difficult conversations about rate increases into collaborative, data-supported strategy sessions.

AI Integration

I incorporated AI throughout ECAT to enhance value and transparency:

Financial & Economic Insights

The 25% tariff increases Enterprise’s fleet acquisition costs by ~$256M per year

Pre-tariff acquisition inflation was already ~$45M per year

Rising costs push rental rates higher, potentially lowering volume

Market equilibrium shifts: reduced demand, higher price expectations

To balance these effects, Enterprise must justify value—not just price

Meeting Strategy for Corporate Reviews

The annual account review meeting is structured around transparency, data, and partnership:

Begin with transparency
Explain tariff impact using ECAT’s AI-generated cost breakdowns.

Show the client’s annual usage & savings opportunities
Use machine learning insights to highlight inefficiencies and possible cost reductions.

Introduce ECAT tiers
Demonstrate how loyalty benefits offset increases in rental rates.

Present value, not just cost
Emphasize Enterprise’s reliability, global scale, and service consistency.

Collaborate on next-year planning
Offer tailored fleet access, upgrade paths, or perks aligned to their travel needs.

The objective is to turn a difficult rate-increase meeting into a data-driven partnership discussion.
